# Readable: Web Application with posts and comments

## Project Overview

This is a project exercise made to pass part of the Udacity Reactjs Nanodegree. We had to build a content and comment web app where users will be able to post to predefined catoogries (anonymously), comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

The objective of this project is to manage state with Redux, so we will focus more on the process on how to organize and architect the code structure and Redux Store than on the design or the tests.

## About

Instead of using the helpful create-react-app we are using the ARC React boilerplate tool: https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/wiki/Setup
